Random problem generator for multi-task reinforcement learning problems.

## Building

Requires python3 and the following packages:
- numpy
- scipy
- networkx

Note that a python3 compatible networkx may be tough to find for your
distribution of Linux. There is a debian package available in experimental
though which works fine.
